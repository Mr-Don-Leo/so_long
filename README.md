# Project Plan for "so_long"

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: so_long
- **Objective**: Develop a 2D game using miniLibX
- **Key Features**:
    - Top-view perspective
    - Textures and sprites
    - Basic gameplay elements

## 2. Milestones
1. **Map Rendering and Display**
    - Create a basic map structure (e.g., read from a file)
    - Render the map using textures and sprites
    - Display the map on the screen

2. **Player Movement**
    - Implement player movement (arrow keys or WASD)
    - Handle collisions with walls and obstacles
    - Update the display accordingly

3. **Collectibles and Exit**
    - Add collectible items (e.g., coins, keys)
    - Define an exit point
    - Implement win conditions (collect all items and reach the exit)

4. **Bonus Features (Optional)**
    - Add enemies or obstacles
    - Implement animations
    - Enhance graphics and sound effects

## 3. Task Breakdown
- **Map Parsing and Rendering**:
    - Read map data from a file
    - Create a grid representation
    - Render tiles based on textures

- **Player Movement and Collision Detection**:
    - Handle input for player movement
    - Check collisions with walls and obstacles
    - Update player position

- **Collectibles and Exit**:
    - Define collectible items
    - Implement logic for collecting items
    - Detect when the player reaches the exit

- **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Test different scenarios (movement, collisions, win conditions)
    - Debug any issues

## 4. Timeline
- **Week 1**:
    - Set up the environment
    - Parse and render the map

- **Week 2**:
    - Implement player movement
    - Add collectibles and exit

- **Week 3**:
    - Test and debug
    - Add bonus features (if time permits)
